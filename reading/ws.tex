\section{Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the meeting before the LWS meeting: Give yourselves roles (leader, admin, dev, user, \dots).
	If you missed the meeting, write in the TUWEL forum which role you want.
	\item Before the LWS meeting: do the preparation as described in this document.
	\item In the LWS meeting: Create together an architecture that fulfils the goals and present some part of that architecture.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preparation}

Before LWS meeting:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read this text.
	\item Think about what your role represents and what would be important for you.
	\item Look through materials relevant for the LWS meeting to familiarize yourself with the concepts.
	\item Search the Internet which technologies are available.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goals}

We want to design the software architecture of a camera system that:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item is configuration-management friendly
	\item has transient and persistent configuration consistent
	\item has correct documentation
	\item reuses software as much as possible but integrate them nicely
\end{enumerate}

\section{Requirements}

The product manager wants a camera that:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item should be able to take single pictures and streams
	\item should have pluggable camera modules (lenses, image sensor, ...)
	\item should have camera profiles for modules of different vendors
	\item should have a Web-UI that shows all configuration settings
	\item should support a remote configuration protocol (Web, SNMP, CMs, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item design the architecture of configuration settings
	\item design the architecture of configuration access
	\item design how the CM tools should look like
	\item tracer bullet~\cite{hunt1999pragmatic}: explain for one configuration setting the whole way from source to destination
	\item make decisions (which (CM) languages, which (CM) software, how to achieve the goals)
	\item explain how to ensure smooth configuration upgrades
	\item explain how to provide documentation for configuration
% OT:	\item explain how to reuse software
\end{enumerate}
