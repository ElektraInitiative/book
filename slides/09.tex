	\end{task}

	\pause

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration settings are simply an instantiation of the configuration specifications.
		Code describing the instantiation is \textbf{CM code}.
	\item configuration design is explicit (like transformations and default values) and can help while writing CM code.
	\item CM code can even be generated from the specification.
	\item access specifications make access trivial via uniform interface.
	\item visibility and similar techniques may help dealing with complexity.

	\item manual configuration changes by administrators
	\item manual configuration changes by end users
	\item differences in updates (e.g., skipped or failed updates)

	\begin{itemize} %[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Push is more interactive.
	\item Push cannot do its job if nodes are not reachable.
	\item Push needs additional techniques to scale with many nodes.
	\item Push demands access to servers from a single server.
	\item Pull needs additional monitoring to know when a patch has been applied.

	\[
		f(f(x))=f(x)

	\item[Self-describing]
	means that from the configuration file alone we are able to derive the correct internal representation.~\cite{wadler2003xml}

\section{Error Messages}

\subsection{}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{Motivation (Recapitulation)}

	Error messages are extremely important as they are the main communication channel to system administrators.\\
	Example specification:
	\vspace{1em}

	\begin{code}[morekeywords={assign,math},gobble=4]
	[a]
	  check/type:=long
	[b]
	  check/type:=long
	[c]
	  check/range:=0-10
	  assign/math:=../a+../b
	\end{code}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Considerations (Recapitulation)}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Generic vs.\ specific plugins
	\item General principles of good error messages~\cite{lee2011personifying}
	\item Give context
	\item Precisely locate the cause
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Further Considerations}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration design first: avoid errors if possible
	\item should not leak internals~\cite{brown1983error}
	\item ``edit here mentality'': never point to correct statements~\cite{marceau2011mind}
	\item do not propose solutions~\cite{marceau2011mind}
	\item reduce vocabulary~\cite{marceau2011mind}
	\item precision and recall\footnote{terms from classification, it is the numerical counterpart of soundness and completeness}~\cite{wrenn2017error}
	\item tension between providing enough information and not overwhelming the user~\cite{wrenn2017error}
	\item colors might help~\cite{wrenn2017error}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Error Messages for Misconfiguration~\cite{zhang2015proactive}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item error messages are often the sole data source
	\item tool uses misconfiguration injection and check if error message point to the correct setting
	\item needs system tests
	\item missing error message means the configuration specification is not complete
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Context for error messages}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item pin-point key and value
	\item show mountpoint (to make relative keys unique)
	\item show file name and line number
	\item unclear: show module and source code lines (for debugging)

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item system administrators: the unsung heroes
	\item interest of understanding administrators emerged around 2002~\cite{anderson2002researching}.
	\item field study also done in industry \cite{barrett2004field}.
	\item Typical methods are surveys, diary studies, interviews and observations (ethnographic field study).
	\item Barrett \cite{barrett2003system} tried to initiate a workshop at CHI 2003 to draw the attention of the HCI community towards system administration.
	\item The workshop was already dropped in the next year.
	\item The tenor is that ``tools ... are not well aligned''~\cite{haber2007design}

	\item system administrator misunderstood problem (had a wrong assumption)
	\item 7 people sought attention and trust, competing to tell him what to do
	\item due to wrong assumption communicated to everyone, people could not help
	\item there were several instances in which the admin ignored or misinterpreted evidence of the real problem
	\item eventually someone else solved the problem: from/to port was switched and firewall blocked these requests
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{other cases~\cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item lost semicolon: execution of script failed due to missing semicolon, then they tried to delete non-existent table
	\item crontab: onltape/ofltape confused because of discussion about offline backup (although an online backup should be performed)
	\item crit sit: many system administrators tried to write simple script, they competed against each other. The crit sit continued for two weeks
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Haber \cite{haber2007design}}

	Later Haber \cite{haber2007design} repeated a ethnographic field study.
	The stories are similar to \cite{barrett2004field}.
	They study was also conducted in the same company.

	\item \p{90} is spent with communicating with other admins
	\item \p{20} of the time is spent in diversions~\cite{barrett2004field}
	\item \p{20} of the time people communicated about \emph{how to communicate}~\cite{barrett2004field}
	\item \p{6} is gathering information and running commands
	\item quality control: monitoring found that non-functional service was down two days
	\item CLIs were generally preferred
	\item configuration and log files were scattered, poorly organized and often used inconsistent terminology
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{design principles \cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item syntax checking is essential
	\item replicating actions should be easy
	\item undo important
	\item do not assume a complete mental model (``if understand the system is a prerequisite [...], we are lost'')
	\item do not assume programming skills (only \p{35} reported having a bachelor's degree)
	\item trust in CLI tools but little trust in GUIs (is the information up-to-date?)
	\item errors should not lead to inconsistent state
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{design principles \cite{haber2007design}}

	Many design principles for tools were be given~\cite{haber2007design}:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration and logs should be displayed in an uniform way
	\item APIs/plugins for tools should be provided
	\item errors in configuration need to be discovered quickly
	\item confusion of similar settings should be avoided: add links, explain interactions
	\item provide means of comparing configuration settings
	\item provide consistent profiles of information
	\item both transient and persistent settings should be visible
	\item when errors occur: always display which changes have been made
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{}

	In Velasquez~\cite{velasquez2008designing} interviews and a survey were combined.
	In interviews they found out that which tools were used by administrators varied widely.
	The main part of the paper, however, was quantitative.
	The result of the study was which attributes of tool are considered as important.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{}

	Further directions:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Is the extensive communication wanted?
	\item Is it different when using CM tools?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{}

	Elektra's goals are:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item it should be easy to develop new tools
	\end{itemize}
