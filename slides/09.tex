	\end{task}

	\pause

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration settings are simply an instantiation of the configuration specifications.
		Code describing the instantiation is \textbf{CM code}.
	\item configuration design is explicit (like transformations and default values) and can help while writing CM code.
	\item CM code can even be generated from the specification.
	\item access specifications make access trivial via uniform interface.
	\item visibility and similar techniques may help dealing with complexity.

	\begin{itemize} %[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Push is more interactive.
	\item Push cannot do its job if nodes are not reachable.
	\item Push needs additional techniques to scale with many nodes.
	\item Push demands access to servers from a single server.
	\item Pull needs additional monitoring to know when a patch has been applied.

	\item[Self-describing]
	means that from the configuration file alone we are able to derive the correct internal representation.~\cite{wadler2003xml}

	\item[Round-tripping]

	\item tomcat6: files copied by user if \texttt{/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf} does not exist but copy fails because later step creates \texttt{/etc/tomcat6/logging.properties} as root.

\section{Error Messages}

\subsection{}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{Motivation (Recapitulation)}

	Error messages are extremely important as they are the main communication channel to system administrators.\\
	\vspace{0.5em}

	\begin{code}[morekeywords={assign,math},gobble=4]
	[a]
	  check/type:=long
	[b]
	  check/type:=long
	[c]
	  check/range:=0-10

	\end{code}

	\begin{task}
	Where should the error message point to if we change b to 10 \\ (a is unchanged 1)?
	\end{task}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Considerations (Recapitulation)}

	\begin{task}
	What needs to be considered when designing error messages?
	\end{task}

	\begin{itemize} %[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Generic vs.\ specific plugins
	\item Precisely locate the cause (and do not report aftereffects)
	\item Give context
	\item Personification~\cite{lee2011personifying}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Further Considerations}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration design first: avoid errors if possible
	\item precision and recall\footnote{terms from classification, it is the numerical counterpart of soundness and completeness}~\cite{wrenn2017error}
	\item error messages should not leak internals~\cite{brown1983error}
	\item ``edit here mentality'': do not point to correct statements~\cite{marceau2011mind}
	\item do not propose solutions~\cite{marceau2011mind}
	\item reduce vocabulary~\cite{marceau2011mind}
	\item tension between providing enough information and not overwhelming the user~\cite{wrenn2017error}
	\item colors might help~\cite{wrenn2017error}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Error Messages for Misconfiguration~\cite{zhang2015proactive}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item error messages are often the sole data source
	\item tool uses misconfiguration injection and checks if error message point to the correct setting
	\item tool requires system tests
	\item they considered error message as okay if key \emph{or} value is present
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{alertblock}{Implication}
	Missing error message means the configuration specification is not complete.
	\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Context for error messages}

	Error messages should contain:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item pin-point key (which also pin-points to the specification)
	\item repeat relevant parts of values and the specification
	\item show mountpoint (to make relative keys unique)
	\item show file name and line number
	\item ? show module and source code lines (for bugs)

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item system administrators: the unsung heroes!
	\item interest of understanding administrators emerged around 2002~\cite{anderson2002researching}.
	\item field study also done in industry \cite{barrett2004field}.
	\item Typical methods are surveys, diary studies, interviews and observations (ethnographic field study).
	\item Barrett \cite{barrett2003system} tried to initiate a workshop at CHI 2003 to draw the attention of the HCI community towards system administration.
	\item The workshop was already dropped in the next year.
	\item The tenor is that ``tools ... are not well aligned''~\cite{haber2007design}.
	\item Research mainly looks at pre-CM. Manual administration is still standard (Source: e.g., Luke Kanies).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Tasks}

	What do system administrators do?

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]

	\item 7 people sought attention and trust, competing to tell the admin what to do
	\item due to wrong assumption the admin communicated to everyone, people could not help
	\item there were several instances in which the admin ignored or misinterpreted evidence of the real problem
	\item eventually someone else solved the problem: admin confused ``from''/``to'' port in the settings and firewall blocked requests
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{other cases~\cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item lost semicolon: execution of script failed due to missing semicolon, then they tried to delete a non-existent table.
	\item crontab: onltape/ofltape confused because of discussion about offline backup (although an online backup should be performed).
	\item crit sit: many system administrators tried to write simple script, they competed against each other. The crit sit continued for two weeks.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\citet{haber2007design}}

	Later \citet{haber2007design} repeated a ethnographic field study.
	The stories are similar to \citet{barrett2004field}.
	Their study was also conducted in the same company.
	They created personas:

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Findings \cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item syntax checking is essential
	\item replicating actions (e.g., to production) is error-prone
	\item undo not available
	\item do not assume a complete mental model (``if understand the system is a prerequisite [...], we are lost'')
	\item do not assume programming skills (only \p{35} reported having a bachelor's degree)
	\item trust in CLI tools but little trust in GUIs (is the information up-to-date?)
	\item errors while executing scripts lead to inconsistent state, rerunning often does not work (if not idempotent)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Design Principles \cite{haber2007design}}

	Many design principles for tools were given~\cite{haber2007design}:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration and logs should be displayed in a uniform way
	\item APIs/plugins for tools should be provided
	\item errors in configuration need to be discovered quickly
	\item confusion of similar settings should be avoided: add links, explain interactions
	\item provide means of comparing configuration settings
	\item provide consistent profiles of information
	\item both transient and persistent settings should be visible
	\item when errors occur: always display which changes have been made (modern approach is idempotence)
	\end{itemize}

	Replicate parts that work well, automate error-prone parts.

	\frametitle{Precise Editing}

	Partial modifications (precise editing) is natural for humans. \\
	It ensures preservations of (potentially security-relevant!) defaults. \\
	In CM, however, following methods are used:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>] %[leftmargin=0cm] %TODO: move left
	\item embed shell commands to do the work
	\item replace full content of configuration files
	\item replace full content of configuration files with templates
	\item line based manipulation (e.g., file\_line): match line and replace it
	\item Augeas/XML: match a key with XPath and replace it
	\item Elektra: set the value of a key
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Apply to CM}

	Elektra's goals are:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item it should be easy to develop new high-level tools
	\item precise editing: change the configuration value as specified
	\end{itemize}

	\pause[\thebeamerpauses]  %  show after \begin{itemize}[<+->]

	Administrators/Devs still need to:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item intensively review and improve the specifications
	\item test (and debug) configuration settings
	\end{itemize}

	\pause[\thebeamerpauses]  %  show after \begin{itemize}[<+->]

	Open topics (incomplete):

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item global optimizations/self-healing
	\item safe migrations of settings and data
	\item collaboration
	\item management (including knowledge)
	\end{itemize}
