\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{User View}

	Who is the user of CM?

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item End Users?
	\item Developers (devs)?
	\item System Administrators (admins)?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{System Administrator Research}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Interest of understanding administrators emerged around 2002~\cite{anderson2002researching}.
	\item Typical methods are surveys, diary studies, interviews and observations (ethnographic field studies).
	\item Field studies also done in industry \cite{barrett2004field}.
	\item Barrett \cite{barrett2003system} tried to initiate a workshop at CHI 2003 to draw the attention of the HCI community towards system administration.
	\item The workshop was already dropped in the next year.
	\item The tenor is that ``tools ... are not well aligned''~\cite{haber2007design}.
	\item Research mainly looks at pre-CM. Manual administration is still standard (Source: e.g., Luke Kanies).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{CM research}

	In the meanwhile at Large Installation System Administrator Conference (LISA):

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item began as CFengine Workshop at LISA 2001
	\item CM workshop by Paul Anderson~\cite{anderson2002researching}
	\item in LISA 2003 an informal poll asked about CM tools: \\
	 	the only user of each tool in the room at the time was its author~\cite{burgess2006modeling}
	\item it is easy to invent CM tools (and configuration file formats)
	\item it is difficult to make it useful beyond your own goals
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Tasks}

	What do system administrators do?

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item keep our infrastructure running
	\item coordinate
	\item do backups
	\item manage hardware
	\item do inventory
	\item install applications
	\item manage security
	\item configure applications
	\item troubleshoot
	\item $\implies$ the unsung heroes!
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{7 people, 1 command-line~\cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item system administrator misunderstood problem \\ (had a wrong assumption)
	\item 7 people sought attention and trust, competing to tell the admin what to do
	\item due to wrong assumption the admin communicated to everyone, people could not help
	\item there were several instances in which the admin ignored or misinterpreted evidence of the real problem
	\item eventually someone else solved the problem: admin confused ``from''/``to'' port in the settings and firewall blocked requests
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{other cases~\cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item lost semicolon: execution of script failed due to missing semicolon, then they tried to delete a non-existent table.
	\item crontab: onltape/ofltape confused because of discussion about offline backup (although an online backup should be performed).
	\item crit sit: many system administrators competed against each other trying to write a simple script. The crit sit continued for two weeks.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\citet{haber2007design}}

	Later \citet{haber2007design} repeated an ethnographic field study.
	The stories are similar to \citet{barrett2004field}.
	Their study was also conducted in the same company.
	They created personas:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item database administrator
	\item web administrator
	\item security administrator
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Database Administrator~\cite{haber2007design}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item frequent contact via phone, e-mail and IM
	\item needs to work on weekends
	\item pair-programming for new tasks
	\item typical errors: stopping wrong database process
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Web Administrator~\cite{haber2007design}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item crit sit
	\item deploying new Web applications
	\item about 20-400 steps to deploy an application
	\item moving from test to production done by hand
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Security Administrator~\cite{haber2007design}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item gets emails on suspicious activities
	\item multi-user chat
	\item ad-hoc scripts
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\citet{haber2007design}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item ``if data is lost...that is when you write your résumé.''
	\item \p{90} is spent with communicating with other admins
	\item \p{20} of the time is spent in diversions~\cite{barrett2004field}
	\item \p{20} of the time people communicated about \emph{how to communicate}~\cite{barrett2004field}
	\item \p{6} is gathering information and running commands
	\item quality control: monitoring found that non-functional service was down two days
	\item CLIs were generally preferred
	\item configuration and log files are scattered, poorly organized and often used inconsistent terminology
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Findings \cite{barrett2004field}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item syntax checking is essential
	\item replicating actions (e.g., to production) is error-prone
	\item undo not available
	\item do not assume a complete mental model (``if understand the system is a prerequisite [...], we are lost'')
	\item do not assume programming skills (only \p{35} reported having a bachelor's degree)
	\item trust in CLI tools but little trust in GUIs (is the information up-to-date?)
	\item errors while executing scripts lead to inconsistent state, rerunning often does not work (if not idempotent)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Design Principles \cite{haber2007design}}

	Many design principles for tools were given~\cite{haber2007design}:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item configuration and logs should be displayed in a uniform way
	\item APIs/plugins for tools should be provided
	\item errors in configuration need to be discovered quickly
	\item confusion of similar settings should be avoided: add links, explain interactions
	\item provide means of comparing configuration settings
	\item provide consistent profiles of information
	\item both transient and persistent settings should be visible
	\item when errors occur: always display which changes have been made (modern approach is idempotence)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Apply to CM}

	What can we learn from system administration research?

	\setbeamersize{description width=1cm}
	\begin{description}[<+-| alert@+>] %[leftmargin=0cm] %TODO: move left
	\item[$+$] intensive review process catches errors
	\item[$-$] collaboration ineffective
	\item[$-$] context/situational awareness is essential
	\item[$+$] precise editing of configuration files works well
	\item[$-$] global optimizations difficult
	\item[$+$] self-written tools are very efficient
	\end{description}

	\pause[\thebeamerpauses]  %  show after \begin{itemize}[<+->]

	\begin{alertblock}{Idea}
	Replicate parts that work well, automate error-prone parts.
	\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Precise Editing}

	Partial modifications (precise editing) is natural for humans. \\
	It ensures preservations of (potentially security-relevant!) defaults. \\
	In CM, however, following methods are used:

	\setbeamersize{description width=1cm}
	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>] %[leftmargin=0cm] %TODO: move left
	\item embed shell commands to do the work
	\item replace full content of configuration files
	\item replace full content of configuration files with templates
	\item line based manipulation (e.g., file\_line): match line and replace it
	\item Augeas/XML: match a key with XPath and replace it
	\item Elektra: set the value of a key
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	Key/value access in puppet-libelektra:

	\begin{code}[morekeywords={kdbkey,kdbmount,ensure,value},gobble=4]
	kdbmount {'system/sw/samba':
		ensure => 'present',
		file => '/etc/samba/smb.conf',
		plugins => 'ini'
	}
	kdbkey {'system/sw/samba/global/workgroup':
		ensure => 'present',
		value => 'MY_WORKGROUP'
	}
	kdbkey {'system/sw/samba/global/log level':
		ensure => 'absent'
	}
	\end{code}

	Uniqueness of keys is essential.
	Ideally, applications already mount their configuration at installation.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Apply to CM}

	Elektra's goals are that it should:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item be easy to develop new high-level tools
	\item support manual workflows and scripts
	\item support precise editing:\\ only change the configuration value as specified
	\item provide a language for both devs and admins
	\end{itemize}

	\pause[\thebeamerpauses]  %  show after \begin{itemize}[<+->]

	Admins/devs still need to:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item reduce the configuration space
	\item intensively review and improve the specifications
	\item test (and debug) configuration settings
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	Key/value specifications in puppet-libelektra:

		value => 'MY_WORKGROUP',
		check => {
			'type' => 'short',
			'range' => '0-10',
			'default' => '1',
			'description' => 'Sets the amount of log/
				debug messages that are sent to the
				log file. 0 is none, 3 is consider-
				able.'
	}
	\end{code}

	Ideally, applications already specify their settings.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Key/Values Revisited}

	Decide about \textbf{changeability} per key:

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Who is responsible (end user, packages, admin manual or CM).
	\item In which namespaces apps search the key (cascading lookup).
	\item Who can see it (visibility).
	\item Who can edit it (admin, end user, both).
	\item Which configuration values are allowed (validation).
	\end{itemize}

	\pause[\thebeamerpauses]  %  show after \begin{itemize}[<+->]

	\begin{alertblock}{Changeability}
	Ownership of every key must be very clear and documented.

		check => {
			'namespaces/#0' => 'user',

			'visibility' => 'important',
			'default' => 'false',
			'check/type' => 'boolean'
	}
	\end{code}

	Ideally, applications already specify their settings.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Layers of Abstractions}

	Recursively define useful abstractions (meta-levels):

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Bits in (configuration) files and memory
	\item Key/value view of configuration settings
	\item Goals/specifications of settings per node and instantiations of modules
	\vspace{1em}
	\item CM code to instantiate settings in the whole network
	\item Global optimization: allocation of nodes and decision regarding topology in the whole network
	\item Global goals/specifications of the whole network
	\end{itemize}

	Break.
	\end{task}
\end{assignment}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Design Rules~\cite{burgess2006modeling}}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item Factor processes into containers to avoid overlaps in settings.
	\item Maintain clear separation of ownership (for every key).
	\item Specify replicated settings in a single source (use links and derivations).
	\item Document all remaining overlaps (in the specification).
	\item The manageability of settings is reduced by the number of possible configuration values.
	\item Do not separate configuration management and monitoring.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Open Topics}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item global optimizations/self-healing
	\item configuration integration
	\item safe migrations of settings and data
	\item collaboration
	\item management (including knowledge)
	\item centralized vs.\ distributed
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Conclusion}

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
	\item create stateless transactions with key/values (get/set)
	\item be aware of the specifications, solving CM is solving constraints
	\item do not design around tools but design tools around you
	\item be brave and remove all configuration settings you can
	\item use all help you can get: e.g.\ build tools, preseeding, installer automation, virtualization, package managers, distributions
	\item complexity in CM vs.\ complexity in applications' specification
	\item modularity is essential for validation and legacy support
	\item artifact generation improves consistency and type safety
