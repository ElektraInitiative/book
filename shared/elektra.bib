                   ubiquitous computing paradigm, whereas a well
                   designed model is a key accessor to the context in
                   any context-aware system. This paper provides a
                   survey of the the most relevant current approaches to
                   modeling context for ubiquitous computing. Numerous
                   approaches are reviewed, classified relative to their
                   core elements and evaluated with respect to their
                   appropriateness for ubiquitous computing.},

                   invasive composition operators do all the work.},

  abstract =      {DySCAS is a dynamically self-configuring middleware
                   for automotive control systems. The addition of
                   autonomic, context-aware dynamic configuration to
                   automotive control systems brings a potential for a
                   wide range of benefits in terms of robustness,
                   flexibility, upgrading etc. However, the automotive
                   systems represent a particularly challenging domain
                   for the deployment of autonomics concepts, having a
                   combination of real-time performance constraints,
                   severe resource limitations, safety-critical aspects
                   and cost pressures. For these reasons current systems
                   are statically configured. This paper describes the
                   dynamic run-time configuration aspects of DySCAS and
                   focuses on the extent to which context-aware
                   adaptation has been achieved in DySCAS, and the ways
                   in which the various design and implementation
                   challenges are met.},

  abstract =      {In this paper, we introduce an architecture
                   description language (ADL) for PCOMs (a context
                   oriented component model). The language is described
                   at three levels: (1) Building blocks (PCOMs context
                   oriented components types) (2) Connectors, which
                   connect components externally and internally, and (3)
                   Architectural Configuration, which includes a full
                   description of composition and decomposition
                   mechanisms. The contribution is designing ADL. That
                   supports context-orinted component by providing new
                   architecture elements, which fulfil the requirements
                   of designing context oriented component based
                   applications. Context oriented component is a
                   behavioural unit composed of static parts and dynamic
                   parts. A PCOMs component model design was introduced
                   in our previous work. PCOMs proposes a component
                   model design to compose context-aware system by
                   capturing context condition at runtime. The model is
                   a component-based one that modifies the application
                   architecture by subdividing components into
                   subsystems of static and dynamic elements. We map
                   each context condition to a composable template
                   architectural configuration. Each context condition
                   acts to select behavioural patterns, which combine to
                   form application architectures. Different types of
                   architecture elements are proposed in this work. We
                   focus in defining the following new elements:
                   Components' dynamic and static parts, components'
                   layers, decision policies, and composition plan.
                   Finally we introduce an ADL that fully supports
                   context aware applications, by supporting the
                   definition of a component as a unit of behaviour. Our
                   ADL clearly defines the composition mechanisms, and
                   provides proper definition for the composition's
                   design Patterns and composition plan. The composition
                   plan is recursively describes the composite
                   components, and the connection between them by
                   describing several design Patterns. A design Pattern
                   typically, shows the relationships and the
                   interactions between components' dynamic behaviour
                   part- .},

  abstract =      {Abstract Nowadays, numerous journals and conferences
                   have published articles related to context-aware
                   systems, indicating many researchers’ interest.
                   Therefore, the goal of this paper is to review the
                   works that were published in journals, suggest a new
                   classification framework of context-aware systems,
                   and explore each feature of classification framework.
                   This paper is based on a literature review of
                   context-aware systems from 2000 to 2007 using a
                   keyword index and article title search. The
                   classification framework is developed based on the
                   architecture of context-aware systems, which consists
                   of the following five layers: concept and research
                   layer, network layer, middleware layer, application
                   layer and user infrastructure layer. The articles are
                   categorized based on the classification framework.
                   This paper allows researchers to extract several
                   lessons learned that are important for the
                   implementation of context-aware systems.},

                   modify existing engineering methods in order to
                   better fit the needs of context-aware computing.
                   These efforts are typically disconnected from each
                   other and generally focus on solving specific
                   development issues. We encourage the creation of a
                   more holistic and unified engineering process that is
                   tailored for the demands of these systems. For this
                   purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the
                   development of context-aware systems, focusing on:
                   (A) Methodologies for developing context-aware
                   systems, analyzing the reasons behind their lack of
                   adoption and features that the community wish they
                   can use; (B) Context-aware system engineering
                   challenges and techniques applied during the most
                   common development stages; (C) Context-aware systems
                   conceptualization.},

                   exploring the use of formal ontologies as a way of
                   specifying content-specific agreements for the
                   sharing and reuse of knowledge among software
                   entities. We take an engineering perspective on the
                   development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are
                   viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific
                   purposes and evaluated against objective design
                   criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in
                   supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then
                   present a set of criteria to guide the development of
                   ontologies for these purposes. We show how these
                   criteria are applied in case studies from the design
                   of ontologies for engineering mathematics and
                   bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are
                   discussed, and alternative representation choices are
                   evaluated against the design criteria.},

  title =         {Self-adaptive concurrent components},
  year =          {2017},
  abstract =      {Selecting the optimum component implementation
                   variant is sometimes difficult since it depends on
                   the component's usage context at runtime, for
                   example, on the concurrency level of the application
                   using the component, call sequences to the component,
                   actual parameters, the hardware available etc. A
                   conservative selection of implementation variants
                   leads to suboptimal performance, for example, if a
                   component is conservatively implemented as
                   thread-safe while during the actual execution it is
                   only accessed from a single thread. In general, an
                   optimal component implementation variant cannot be
                   determined before runtime and a single optimal
                   variant might not even exist since the usage contexts
                   can change significantly over the runtime. We
                   introduce self-adaptive concurrent components that
                   automatically and dynamically change not only their
                   internal representation and operation implementation
                   variants but also their synchronization mechanism
                   based on a possibly changing usage context. The most
                   suitable variant is selected at runtime rather than
                   at compile time. The decision is revised if the usage
                   context changes, for example, if a single-threaded
                   context changes to a highly contended concurrent
                   context. As a consequence, programmers can focus on
                   the semantics of their systems and, for example,
                   conservatively use thread-safe components to ensure
                   consistency of their data, while deferring
                   implementation and optimization decisions to
                   context-aware runtime optimizations. We demonstrate
                   the effect on performance with self-adaptive
                   concurrent queues, sets, and ordered sets. In all
                   three cases, experimental evaluation shows close to
                   optimal performance regardless of actual contention.},

                   concurrent (and sometimes also in sequential) systems
                   it is more useful to regard a type as a contract
                   between an object and the unity of all users: The
                   users must be coordinated before sending messages to
                   the object. Types in the proposed model express
                   requirements on the coordination of users; objects
                   must accept messages only in pre-specified orders.
                   The model ensures statically that objects behave as
                   specified by their types, and users are coordinated
                   appropriately.},

  abstract="Due to the competitiveness of the computing industry, software developers are pressured to quickly deliver new code releases. At the same time, operators are expected to update and keep production systems stable at all times. To overcome the development--operations barrier, organizations have started to adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to efficiently deploy middleware and applications using automation scripts. These automations comprise a series of steps that should be idempotent to guarantee repeatability and convergence. Rigorous testing is required to ensure that the system idempotently converges to a desired state, starting from arbitrary states. We propose and evaluate a model-based testing framework for IaC. An abstracted system model is utilized to derive state transition graphs, based on which we systematically generate test cases for the automation. The test cases are executed in light-weight virtual machine environments. Our prototype targets one popular IaC tool (Chef), but the approach is general. We apply our framework to a large base of public IaC scripts written by operators, showing that it correctly detects non-idempotent automations.",
